Project: PRISM – Post-Production Management System
Strict Rules:

❌ Do NOT break any existing booking, calendar, or report logic

❌ Do NOT change booking form date behavior (it is already working correctly)

❌ Do NOT change dashboard layout or structure

✅ Only apply the UI + behavior updates listed below

✅ Use existing database and authentication

✅ 1. CALENDAR HEADER RIGHT SIDE – LIVE CURRENT DATE (LOCKED)
❌ Current Issue:

The header date on the right side can be changed manually

You want this to always show LIVE current system date only

✅ Required Fix:

✅ On the right side of the calendar header:

Always display:

LIVE SYSTEM DATE (Auto-updated daily)


Example:

December 5th, 2025


✅ This date must:

✅ Update automatically at midnight

✅ Be fully locked (no date picker, no manual change)

✅ Reflect only the real current date

✅ IMPORTANT:

❌ Do NOT change the Booking Form Date Field

✅ Booking form date must continue to work exactly as it is now (date-wise reflect)

✅ 2. LEFT SIDE HEADER – REMOVE DATE, SHOW LIVE TIME ONLY (12-HOUR FORMAT)
❌ Current Display:
Friday, 5 December 2025

✅ Replace this with a LIVE DIGITAL CLOCK ONLY:

✅ Format:

Day + Time (12-hour format with seconds & AM/PM)


✅ Example:

Friday 10:24:45 AM


✅ Behavior:

✅ Updates every second (real-time)

✅ Syncs with system time

✅ No manual control

✅ No date shown here (ONLY time + day)

✅ 3. SIDEBAR COLOR THEME – LIGHT BLUE (PRISM HEADER UNCHANGED)

✅ Apply:

✅ Light / Slightly Light Blue Color to:

Sidebar background

Sidebar hover state

Sidebar active menu item

✅ Keep:

✅ PRISM heading area in original dark blue

✅ No logo change

✅ No menu structure change

✅ Goal:

More attractive, modern, soft look

Clean contrast between:

PRISM header (dark)

Sidebar + pages (light blue)

✅ 4. ADMIN / PROFILE ICON – OPEN IN FULL VIEW MODE WITH DATA
❌ Current Issue:

Clicking Admin icon does not properly show all profile data in clean view mode

✅ Required Behavior:

✅ When user clicks:

Admin / AD Icon


✅ Open a Profile View Mode (Read-Only First) showing:

Username

Full Name

Role

Company

Mobile Number

Email

User Status

Last Login

✅ Add buttons:

✅ Edit Profile

✅ Close

✅ On clicking Edit Profile:

Switch to edit mode

Allow editing:

Name

Email

Mobile

Password (with confirmation)

✅ Save properly to DB

✅ Show success toast:

Profile updated successfully


✅ Permissions:

✅ Admin → Can edit everything

✅ Normal User → Can edit only personal fields

✅ FINAL ACCEPTANCE CHECKLIST

After implementation, all must work like this:

✅ Right header date = always live current date (locked)
✅ Left header shows only: Day + Live Time (12-hour with seconds)
✅ Sidebar is light blue & PRISM header remains dark blue
✅ Clicking Admin icon opens full profile in view mode
✅ Edit + Save profile works correctly
✅ Booking form date behavior remains untouched
