✅ Replit Professional Prompt – Apply Below Changes to My Existing Project (No Major Functionality Changes)
1️⃣ Cancel Booking – Read-Only Mode

When user clicks Cancel Booking, open the same booking detail screen used for Confirmed / Tentative / Planning bookings.

But the cancel-booking view must be 100% read-only:

No edit

No update

No dropdown changes

Buttons disabled except “Close”

UI must look the same, only disabled state applied.

2️⃣ Booking Dashboard – Show Only 3 Latest Bookings + "More/Explore" Button

When a date has 15+ bookings (e.g., 15 Dec 2025):

Show only latest 3 bookings in dashboard.

Below them show a “More Bookings / Explore” button.

When clicked → open Day View Booking screen (similar to Google Calendar day view).

3️⃣ Booking Dashboard – Add “Day View” Button + “Schedule Booking” Button

On booking dashboard right side of Month Filter, add:

Day View button → opens Google-Calendar style day booking view.

Schedule Booking button → opens booking form.

4️⃣ Implement Lazy Loading (Performance Improvement)

Apply lazy loading across whole project wherever large data appears:

Bookings list

Customer master

Projects master

Rooms

Editors

Reports

Chalan/Invoice

Improve performance without affecting existing logic.

5️⃣ Customer Master – Add “+ Add Designation”

In Designation dropdown:

Add a + icon inside dropdown.

Clicking + opens small popup: “Add New Designation”

If designation does not exist → allow adding.

After saving → automatically appear in dropdown.

Field must support:

Dropdown selection

Manual input if needed

6️⃣ Allow Decimal Inputs

In entire project:

Price / Rate fields → allow decimal values.

Quantity fields → allow decimal values.

Validation should support 2–4 decimal places.

7️⃣ Sorting – Remove Double Arrows

In all date filters:

By default → show ascending records with ↑ arrow.

When clicked → change to descending with ↓ arrow.

Never show both arrows at same time.

Sorting must work on single click, not double click.

8️⃣ Chalan/Invoice – Auto Reflect Booking Data + Role Access

Chalan/Invoice must:

Auto-reflect updated booking details (real-time sync).

Update if booking details change.

Apply role-based access:

Only permissioned users can create / edit chalans.

Others can only view.

9️⃣ Proper Conflict Checking

Implement correct conflict detection in:

Project Master → overlapping project data

Booking Module → booking conflicts (time/day/resource conflicts)

Show clear conflict messages with proper UI.

🔟 User Rights System – Fix & Enforce

Make role-rights system work properly:

If a role has limited access, user should see only those fields/pages.

Restrict:

Buttons

Edit fields

Modules

Menus

No override unless admin.

1️⃣1️⃣ User Management – Fix Edit UI + Add Fields

Improve user edit UI:

Input icons alignment correction.

Clean, modern UI.

Fields to include:

Username

Password

Mobile

Account/Role

Profile Image Avatar

Email (if available)

Proper edit mode functionality must work with validation.

✅ Important

Do not change major functionality

Keep existing flow intact

Only fix UI, usability, role rights, conflict logic & lazy loading

Ensure everything works smoothly across all modules
